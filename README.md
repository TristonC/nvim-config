# neovim config for deep learning programmers

A repo to config the Neovim on my MacOS and Ubuntu Linux systems. It might need
adjustment if it used in other OS.

My current work mostly focus on deep learing related, so the programming
laguage that use (but not limited to) c++, CUDA, Python, bash, markdown. Many
of my settings follow the
[reference](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024).

## How to use it

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/TristonC/nvim-config.git nvim
```

And then launch your neovim by (replace the /path/to/your/project to the real
path to your project)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/
nvim ./
```
