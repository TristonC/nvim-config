# nvim config for deep learning programmer

A repo to config my Neovim on my MacOS and Ubunto Linux systems. It might need
adjustment if it used in other OS.

My current work mostly focus on deep learing related, so the programming
laguage that use (but not limited to) c++, CUDA, Python, bash, markdown. Many
of my settings follow the
[refernce](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024).

## How to use it

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/TristonC/nvim-config.git nvim
```
